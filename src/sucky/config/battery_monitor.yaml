    publish_rate: 0.5                # Publish rate in Hz (0.5 Hz = every 2 seconds)
                                     # Slower rate reduces interference with motor control
    
    # Battery voltage thresholds (adjust for your battery type)
    min_voltage: 22.0                # Low battery warning threshold (V)
    max_voltage: 29.4                # High battery warning threshold (V)
                                     # Example for 7S LiPo: 25.2V nominal, 29.4V full, 21.0V cutoff

                                     # For 7S LiPo: 20.5V (2.93V per cell) gives good safety margin
                                     # For 6S LiPo: 18.0V (3.0V per cell) gives good safety margin
    shutdown_delay: 30.0             # Delay before shutdown in seconds (allows time to cancel)
    shutdown_consecutive_readings: 3 # Number of consecutive low readings before shutdown
                                     # Prevents shutdown on voltage spikes under load
